0. Rotate 2D Matrix

This project implements an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in Python.

Description

The main task is to create a function `rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)` that rotates a given n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. The rotation must be done in-place, meaning the original matrix should be modified without creating a new matrix.

Concepts Covered

- Matrix representation in Python
- In-place operations
- Matrix transposition
- Reversing rows in a matrix
- Nested loops for 2D data structures
